This program project including five parts.
1. ckpt_save. This folder contains the trained models
              including the model with best validation result (best_test.pth.gz) and the model saved in the final epoch (latest_train.pth.gz).
2. Network. This folder contains the python file (FFMNet.py)
            defining the network architecture (referred the class "MixAttNet").
3. DataOp.py. This file define the data operation for supporting the test.
              Check the comments in function "get_list" to figure out the details of how to read data.
4. Infer.py. The main test file
5. Utils.py. Some support functions, not important.

Please check the DataOp.py first and process all of the data according to the comments.
and then run the infer.py to test the data

Tips in infer.py:
1. define the model loading path in line-17
2. define the data loading path in line-20
3. if the mask is unavailable, please remove the codes related to the mask variable.
