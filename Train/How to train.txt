How to train?

The whole program contains five parts.
1. Network.py. The python file to define the proposed network (referred to the class "MixAttNet").
2. volumentations.  A third-party library for 3D image data augmentation.
3. DataOp.py. The python file to define the data operation supporting functions.
              Some variables should be concerns when training with own data.
              Line-32/33, The name of image and ground truth
              Line-44/45, The ratio for splitting dataset into training, validation and testing.
              Line-116, The ratio to increase the patch sampling probability in the label area.
4. Train.py. The main file for training.
5. Utils.py. Some supporting function, not important.

Please check the DataOp comments at first, and settle the dataset as it.
Then, run the Train.py to train the network.

Hyper-parameters and path setting are clearly defined in the Train.py.
